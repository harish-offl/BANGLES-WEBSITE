 * empty set for a status means no further transition is permitted from there
 * (terminal states such as `delivered` or `cancelled`).
 *
 * Exceptional statuses (`payment_pending`, `payment_failed`, `stock_unavailable`,
 * `return_requested`, etc.) are reachable from their parent states and can
 * return to the main flow where business rules allow.
